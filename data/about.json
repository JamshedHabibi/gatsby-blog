  "description": "22 year old Londoner with a huge passion for travel, filming, (vegetarian) food, and style. I love learning and creating so a blog just seemed right, and having just graduated from university with a law degree, I have way too much spare time.\n\nI've been writing (mostly novels) since I was about 15 years old and I've always felt that writing comes more naturally to me than talking. If you take a look at my YouTube channel, Bambina Katarina, you will probably see what I mean. Bambina Katarina started off as a space to share my travels in a memorable way. Filming my favourite destinations and putting the clips to music made it easy to revisit the memories I made with my friends and family, and my boyfriend, Jamshed.\n\nI seriously have no clue what's going to happen next. The year ahead, which I thought was all mapped out, U-turned in a matter of days. But I am a big believer in everything happening for a reason.\n\nSo feel free to follow me and find out."
