  "description": "Hi, I’m Kat and I’m a 22 year old book enthusiast and amateur writer from London. I love creating so a blog just seemed right.\n\n\n\nI started this blog last summer after graduating from University with a law degree, not knowing what I wanted to do or where I was going to end up. I had a checklist of achievements to tick off: get a job to build up my experience, go travelling, and figure out where I wanted to start in my career. Since then, I have discovered that I love sharing my joy of books, I have travelled to the best places in the world, and I have a pretty good idea which direction I want my life to head in.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, I’m very focused on my bookish content. I’m really enjoying writing mini reviews, and hopefully I can go on to do some tbrs and monthly wrap ups! Also, look out for some bookish vlogs coming soon on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwp6yuXeUZBSI6n1RrDMEw?view_as=subscriber)."
