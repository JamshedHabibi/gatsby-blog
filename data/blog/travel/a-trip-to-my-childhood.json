  "body": "\nA couple of weeks ago, my best friend, Amy, invited me on a family trip to Marloes Sands. I practically spent my childhood split between London and Pembrokeshire in South West Wales. But since my granny moved away from Pembrokeshire and to Cardiff I have been longing for the coast. The sea has seriously been calling me. \n\nObviously I said yes! So off we went on the five hour journey from London Paddington to Haverfordwest.\n\n\nBoth Amy's family and ours have rescued dogs from shelters in Romania. Indie, Amy's dog, is very wary of strangers, probably due to the cruelty she must have experienced before she was rescued. She has parts of her ear and tail missing, and is especially worried when she sees men with sticks, so we can only imagine what she might have gone through. \r\n\n\r![](/images/952696_b6edccbfc8ca483b9ac1f02fe98b1c3c_mv2_d_5472_3648_s_4_2.webp)\n\n\r\nEven though I have spent time at Amy's house, Indie still wasn't completely relaxed around me, which must've been exhausting for her. So my goal to bond with Indie was a big priority for this trip. She's got layers. Haha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, we wasted no time getting down to the beach. Marloes Sands is without a doubt the best beach I've been to in the UK. It's extensively long, and sandy, is not too busy, and has great waves. It was used as the location for the castle in Snow White and the Huntsman, starring Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, if that means anything to anyone. "
