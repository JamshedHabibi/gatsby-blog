#By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in backend.
#adding this line adds an extra interface for drafting, reviewing and approving posts.
publish_mode: editorial_workflow

#allows user to upload image directly within the editor.
#Works by pointing CMS to folder which holds media, i.e. images/uploads
media_folder: static/assets #specifies where uploaded files are saved in the repo
public_folder: /assets #indicates where they are found in the published site. image src attribute uses this path, which is relative to the file where its called. For this reason, we usually start the path at site root, using the opening '/'.
#if public_folder is not set, netlify CMS defaults to the same value as media_folder, adding an opening '/' if one is not included.

#Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site.
collections:
  - name: blog # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
    label: Blog # Used in the UI
    folder: blog # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
      - { name: path, label: Path, widget: string }
      - { name: date, label: Date, widget: datetime }
      - { name: title, label: Title, widget: string }
